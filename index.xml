      <description>Artwork Beef must process all items in your library, and will do so automatically. There are some artwork in the file system that isn&amp;rsquo;t added to Kodi&amp;rsquo;s database with any/many other tools. It will also check web services for new artwork to fill out any media items still missing some, unless &amp;ldquo;Automatically add artwork from file system only&amp;rdquo; is enabled. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been managing movie collection artwork, Kodi sets posters and fanart to those of one of the movies in the collection.</description>

      <description>Downloading and managing local artwork files By default, Artwork Beef does not modify existing local artwork files. There are some options to change that, though. With the settings &amp;ldquo;Download artwork for processed [media type]&amp;rdquo; enabled for a media type it will download all remote artwork for processed items, and any new images selected manually. By default most video library images will be saved next to the media files with the most specific file names detailed below, with options to save movie and music video artwork without the base file name if you like, and options to save movie and music video fanart# to an &amp;ldquo;extrafanart&amp;rdquo; directory for skins using the classic style.</description>

      <description>Because who wants another dependency?
Display multiple fanart Artwork Helper isn&amp;rsquo;t strictly needed, how about that? It is a bit more work though.
The trick is to use a fadelabel control to gather multiple InfoLabels and randomize them, then use that control&amp;rsquo;s label as the final image to be displayed.
&amp;lt;control type=&amp;quot;fadelabel&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;398045&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;description&amp;gt;Randomizer for plugin-free multiple fanart&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt; &amp;lt;top&amp;gt;-1000&amp;lt;/top&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- Don&#39;t need to see it, but can&#39;t change its visibility.</description>

      <description>Artwork Helper provides skins with a few options for building a list of images for a multiimage or list control from images available via InfoLabels. This is a small add-on that skins can use as a dependency, only doing what a skin asks it to do.
Current version only works for Kodi 17 and 18, use version 0.7.1 for 15 and 16.
Add-on setting There is an add-on setting to pull extrafanart and extrathumbs from the filesystem, if there is only a single image in the library.</description>

      <title>Why replace extrafanart/extrathumbs</title>

      <description>Kodi&amp;rsquo;s support for freely named artwork in the library is pretty great, so let&amp;rsquo;s use it! Placing artwork in the library allows skins to work with multiple fanart no matter where they are stored. Avoid filesystem delays/access issues (unavailable network file system, removable media) when the images have been cached. Classic extrafanart always hits the file system at least once when first listing the path to get a list of the images, even if they are all cached.</description>
